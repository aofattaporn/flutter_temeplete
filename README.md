# Flutter Clean Architecture Template

Welcome to the **Flutter Clean Architecture Template**! This project is a starting point for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Flutter apps using Clean Architecture principles.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Organized code into layers for separation of concerns.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable for larger applications.
- **Modular**: Follow the principle of small, reusable modules for a better developer experience.
- **Testable**: Designed to be easily testable at each layer.
- **State Management**: Implements a state management solution that fits with Clean Architecture (e.g., `Provider`, `Riverpod`, `Bloc`).
- **Dependency Injection**: Organized and clear dependency management.

## Architecture Overview

This project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture** to separate concerns and organize the app into distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is where the UI resides, managed by widgets and state management solutions.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and abstract use cases. This layer is independent of the framework.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages the data source, API calls, and repository implementation.
4. **Core Layer**: Common utilities, helper functions, and constants that are used across multiple layers.
